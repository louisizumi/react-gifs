### Giphy Search App

The goal of this challenge was to re-code from scratch the Giphy Search app.

Here's how it looks:
![gif](./react-gifs.gif)

#### 1. Setup

The challenge used the Le Wagon [React boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/react-boilerplate):

#### 2. Features

* When a user types a query, the list of Gifs displays the 10 first results the `giphy-api` returns.
* When a user clicks on a gif from the list, it should appear on the main scene on the left.
* (Optional) When a user focuses in / out of the input, find a nice way to twist the UI on the left part (opacity, background-color, border...) to show your user he's in / out of the input!

#### 3. Potential

* Add an easy way to copy the image address of the selected gif.
