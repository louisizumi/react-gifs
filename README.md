### Giphy Search App

The goal of this challenge was to re-code from scratch the Giphy Search app.

#### 1. Setup

The challenge used the Le Wagon [React boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/react-boilerplate):

#### 2. Features

1. When a user types a query, the list of Gifs displays the 10 first results the `giphy-api` returns.
1. When a user clicks on a gif from the list, it should appear on the main scene on the left.
1. (Optional) When a user focuses in / out of the input, find a nice way to twist the UI on the left part (opacity, background-color, border...) to show your user he's in / out of the input!
